# Vanilla JS Gallery
A simple gallery using vanilla JS and some html manipulation

##Description
My fifth attempt at Web Dev in a class setting. 
In this case, it was an improvement over a previous project.
In the previous project, I used jQuery and a very simple html setup 
to swap photos into a main image tag. This time, I added quite a few
image tags to select from and a random img set and button to randomize it.
